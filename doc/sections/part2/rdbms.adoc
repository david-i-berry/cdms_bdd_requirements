### Database

*As a* data manager,
*I want* the RDBMS module to efficiently store and manage climate data,
*so that* I can ensure data integrity and quick access for analysis.

*Definition of Done:*

* The RDBMS module is implemented and functional.
* Data can be efficiently stored, managed, and retrieved.
* Data integrity constraints are enforced.
* Efficient querying is supported.
* Secure access controls are in place.
* Regular backups and automated recovery processes are implemented.
* The module is scalable to handle large datasets.
* Logs confirm the functionality of the RDBMS module.

*Acceptance Criteria*

* Data Storage:
** The RDBMS module can store various types of climate data, including observational data, derived parameters, and metadata.
** Data is stored in a structured format that supports efficient querying and retrieval.
* Data Integrity
** The RDBMS module enforces data integrity constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) to ensure data consistency.
** Data validation rules are applied to prevent invalid data from being stored.
* Efficient Querying:
** The RDBMS module supports efficient querying of large datasets using SQL.
** Indexes are created on key columns to optimize query performance.
* Secure Access:
** The RDBMS module implements role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify the data.
** Data encryption is applied to sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
* Backup and Recovery:
** The RDBMS module supports regular data backups to prevent data loss.
** Automated recovery processes are in place to restore data in case of failures.
* Scalability:
** The RDBMS module can handle large volumes of data and scale as needed to accommodate growing datasets.

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:*

* Data Ingestion Module
* Data Entry Module
* User Configuration Module
* Security Module
