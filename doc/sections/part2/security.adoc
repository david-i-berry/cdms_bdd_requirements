### Security

#### User Story 1
*As a* user,
*I want* the system to support role-based access control
*so that* data security is maintained.

*Definition of Done:*

* Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented and functional.
* Users have appropriate access based on their roles.
* Access control policies are documented and enforced.
* Logs confirm the functionality of access control.
* Regular audits of access control policies and logs are conducted.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Verify that role-based access control is functional.
* Check logs for access control entries.
* Ensure that users can only access data and functions permitted by their roles.
* Conduct a security audit to verify compliance with access control policies.

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:* None

#### User Story 2

*As a* user,
*I want* the system to enforce strong authentication mechanisms
*so that* unauthorized access is prevented.

*Definition of Done:*

* Strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) are implemented.
* Authentication policies are documented and enforced.
* Logs confirm successful and failed authentication attempts.
* Regular audits of authentication mechanisms and logs are conducted.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Verify that strong authentication mechanisms are functional.
* Check logs for authentication attempts.
* Ensure that unauthorized access attempts are logged and reported.
* Conduct a security audit to verify compliance with authentication policies.

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:* None

#### User Story 3
*As a* user,
*I want* the system to encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit
*so that* data confidentiality is maintained.

*Definition of Done:*

* Encryption mechanisms for data at rest and in transit are implemented.
* Encryption policies are documented and enforced.
* Logs confirm the encryption of sensitive data.
* Regular audits of encryption mechanisms and logs are conducted.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Verify that data encryption mechanisms are functional.
* Check logs for encryption entries.
* Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
* Conduct a security audit to verify compliance with encryption policies.

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:* None

#### User Story 4

*As a* user,
*I want* the system to provide detailed security logging and monitoring
*so that* potential security incidents can be detected and responded to promptly.

*Definition of Done:*

* Security logging and monitoring mechanisms are implemented.
* Logs capture detailed security events (e.g., access attempts, data modifications).
* Monitoring tools provide real-time alerts for potential security incidents.
* Regular reviews of security logs and monitoring alerts are conducted.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Verify that security logging and monitoring mechanisms are functional.
* Check logs for detailed security events.
* Ensure that real-time alerts are generated for potential security incidents.

* Conduct a security audit to verify compliance with logging and monitoring policies.

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:* None

#### User Story 5

*As a* user,
*I want* the system to implement data integrity checks
*so that* any unauthorized data modifications can be detected.

*Definition of Done:*

* Data integrity checks (e.g., checksums, hashes) are implemented.
* Integrity check policies are documented and enforced.
* Logs confirm the results of data integrity checks.
* Regular audits of data integrity mechanisms and logs are conducted.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Verify that data integrity checks are functional.
* Check logs for integrity check entries.
* Ensure that unauthorized data modifications are detected and reported.
* Conduct a security audit to verify compliance with data integrity policies.

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:* None
