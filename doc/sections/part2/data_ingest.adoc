* System correctly identifies and loads files in supported formats (BUFR, GRIB, TAC)
* System provides appropriate error messages for unsupported or corrupted files
* Loading process can be canceled by the user if needed
* File loading performance meets specified thresholds (X MB per minute)

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:* None

*Required for:* Data Ingestion [US-002]

*WMO-No 1131 requirements:* 5.1.1.2, 5.1.1.3, 5.1.1.4



#### Ingestion

*As a* user,
*I want* the system to ingest various data formats (BUFR, GRIB, TAC, etc.)
*so that* I can work with diverse datasets.

*Definition of Done:*

* The system can successfully ingest all specified data formats.
* Ingestion logs are created and accessible.
* Data is available for further processing.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Verify ingestion of each data format.
* Check logs for successful ingestion entries.

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:* None

*Required for*:

*WMO-No 1131 requirements:* 5.1.1.2, 5.1.1.3, 5.1.1.4, 5.1.1.5, 5.1.1.6

#### Logging

*As a* user,
*I want* the system to log the status of data ingestion
*so that* I can monitor the ingestion process.

*Definition of Done:*

* Ingestion status is logged for each data file.
* Logs are accessible and provide clear status updates.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Verify that logs are created for each ingestion attempt.
* Ensure logs are accessible and readable.

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:* Data ingestion functionality

*WMO-No 1131 requirements:* 5.1.1.7

#### Automated recovery

*As a* user,
*I want* the system to perform automated recovery on failed ingests
*so that* data integrity is maintained.

*Definition of Done:*

* Automated recovery processes are triggered on ingestion failure.
* Recovery attempts are logged.
* Data is successfully ingested or appropriate error messages are provided.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Simulate ingestion failures and verify recovery processes.
* Check logs for recovery attempts and outcomes.

*Priority:* Medium

*Dependencies:* Data ingestion functionality

*WMO-No 1131 requirements:* 5.1.1.8

#### Application of business rules

*As a* user,
*I want* the system to apply user-specified business rules during data ingestion
*so that* the data is processed according to my requirements.

*Definition of Done:*

* Business rules are applied during ingestion.
* Data is processed according to specified rules.
* Logs confirm the application of business rules.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Verify that business rules are applied correctly.
* Check logs for rule application entries.

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:* User configuration of business rules

*WMO-No 1131 requirements:* 5.1.1.1

#### Data transformations

*As a* user,
*I want* the system to apply data transformations during ingestion
*so that* the data is in the desired format.

*Definition of Done:*

* Data transformations are applied as specified.
* Transformed data is available for use.
* Logs confirm successful data transformation.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Verify that data transformations are applied correctly.
* Check logs for transformation entries.

*Priority:* Medium

*Dependencies:* Data ingestion functionality

*WMO-No 1131 requirements:* 5.1.1.9

#### Validation and quality control

*As a* user,
*I want* the system to validate data formats, apply constraint checks, consistency checks, statistical checks,
comparison checks, combination checks and spatial checks during ingestion
*so that* the data quality is ensured.

*Definition of Done:*

* All specified checks are applied during ingestion.
* Data quality is validated and confirmed.
* Logs detail the results of each check.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* Verify that all checks are applied correctly.
* Check logs for validation and check entries.

*Priority:* High

*Dependencies:* Data ingestion functionality

*WMO-No 1131 requirements:* 5.3.1.1, 5.3.1.2, 5.3.1.3, 5.3.1.4, 5.3.1.5, 5.3.17, 5.3.1.9
