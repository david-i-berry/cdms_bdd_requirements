Feature: Audit Trail Management

    In order to maintain data integrity and traceability
    As a system administrator
    I want comprehensive audit trails of system activities

    Scenario: Record data modification audit trail
        Given any data modification operation
        When a user or automated process modifies data
        Then the system should record audit information including:
          - User/process identity
          - Timestamp
          - Nature of the modification
          - Previous and new values
          - Justification (where applicable)
        And make audit trails searchable for compliance purposes
        And protect audit records from unauthorized modification
        And maintain audit records according to retention policies
