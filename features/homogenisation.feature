Feature: Homogenization

    In order to create consistent climate records
    As a climate data analyst
    I want to homogenize climate data series

    Scenario: Homogenize climate data series
        Given a climate data series with potential inhomogeneities (requirement 4.5.1.3, 6.1.3)
        And metadata about station history and instrumentation changes
        And suitable reference series for comparison
        And selected homogenization algorithm parameters
        When a user initiates the homogenization process
        Then the system should detect breakpoints in the time series
        And determine adjustment factors for each segment
        And apply homogenization techniques following international best practices
        And produce a homogenized data series with comprehensive adjustment metadata
        And maintain the original data alongside the homogenized series
        And provide visualization of adjustments made
        And include uncertainty estimates for the homogenization process
        And generate a detailed homogenization report

    Scenario: Review and approve homogenization results
        Given completed homogenization process outputs
        And quality metrics for the homogenization
        When a data reviewer examines the homogenization results
        Then the system should provide tools to compare original and homogenized series
        And display detected breakpoints with confidence levels
        And allow manual override of specific adjustments if necessary
        And require documented justification for any manual changes
        And track the approval workflow status
        And maintain an audit trail of the review process

    Scenario: Apply homogenization to multiple related variables
        Given multiple climate variables from the same station
        And known physical relationships between the variables
        When a user initiates multi-variable homogenization
        Then the system should maintain physical consistency between variables
        And apply adjustments that preserve inter-variable relationships
        And document the dependencies between variable adjustments
        And verify consistency of the resulting homogenized series
