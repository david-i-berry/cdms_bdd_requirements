Feature: Quality Control Management

    In order to ensure data quality
    As a data quality manager
    I want to manage quality control checks

    Scenario: Create quality control check
        Given a need for a new quality control check (requirement 5.3.2.1)
        And I am logged in with QC configuration privileges
        When I define the check parameters including:
          - Check type (constraint, consistency, statistical, spatial, etc.)
          - Variable(s) to check
          - Threshold values and conditions
          - Severity level
          - Automated actions to take on failure
        Then the system should create the quality control check
        And validate the check configuration for potential conflicts
        And make it available for assignment
        And add it to the QC check catalog with version information
        And provide a test function to validate the check against sample data

    Scenario: Modify existing quality control check
        Given an existing quality control check
        When a user modifies the check parameters
        Then the system should update the quality control check
        And apply the updated check in future processing

    Scenario: Delete quality control check
        Given an existing quality control check
        When a user requests deletion
        Then the system should remove the quality control check
        And no longer apply it in future processing

    Scenario: Assign quality control check
        Given existing quality control checks
        When a user assigns checks to specific variables or stations
        Then the system should store these assignments
        And apply the assigned checks to the specified data

    Scenario: Schedule quality control check
        Given existing quality control checks
        When a user schedules a check to run at specific times
        Then the system should execute the check according to schedule
        And log the results of each execution
