Feature: Metadata Quality Metrics

    In order to maintain metadata standards
    As a metadata manager
    I want to monitor metadata quality metrics

    Scenario: View metadata quality metrics
        Given stored metadata (requirement 5.5.1.3)
        And defined quality assessment criteria
        When a user accesses the metadata quality dashboard
        Then the system should display quality metrics including:
          - Accuracy scores
          - Consistency measures
          - Standards compliance percentages
          - Update frequency statistics
          - Cross-reference validity
        And highlight areas needing improvement
        And provide trend analysis of quality over time
        And offer specific recommendations for improvement
        And prioritize improvements based on metadata usage patterns

    Scenario: View metadata completeness metrics
        Given stored metadata (requirement 5.5.1.4)
        And defined completeness requirements for different metadata categories
        When a user accesses the metadata completeness dashboard
        Then the system should display completeness metrics including:
          - Required fields completion percentage
          - Optional fields completion percentage
          - Completeness by metadata category (discovery, station, provenance)
          - Completeness by data source or collection
        And identify missing required elements
        And provide a prioritized list of incomplete records
        And offer bulk editing capabilities for systematic improvements
        And track completeness trends over time

    Scenario: Establish metadata quality targets
        Given organizational metadata requirements
        And compliance standards (e.g., WIGOS, ISO)
        When a metadata manager sets quality targets
        Then the system should save the quality thresholds
        And incorporate them into monitoring dashboards
        And trigger notifications when quality falls below targets
        And track progress toward quality improvement goals
