Feature: Observing Network Monitoring

    In order to maintain data collection quality
    As a network manager
    I want to monitor the observing network

    Scenario: Monitor observing network
        Given an operational observing network (requirement 5.3.2.4)
        And defined performance thresholds for stations
        When the monitoring system runs at scheduled intervals
        Then it should collect performance metrics from all stations including:
          - Data availability percentage
          - Message timeliness
          - Sensor status indicators
          - Quality control failure rates
          - Communication statistics
        And display the current status of the network on a geospatial dashboard
        And highlight stations exceeding defined thresholds
        And provide trend analysis of station performance over time
        And generate alerts for stations requiring maintenance

    Scenario: Monitor network during extreme events
        Given an operational observing network
        And an ongoing extreme weather event
        When the monitoring system detects increased data volumes or anomalies
        Then it should increase monitoring frequency for affected stations
        And provide real-time status updates
        And prioritize alerts based on event severity
        And track station outages with estimated restoration times

    Scenario: Generate network performance reports
        Given collected network monitoring data
        And predefined reporting periods (daily, weekly, monthly)
        When a scheduled report generation process runs
        Then the system should compile network performance statistics
        And compare against historical baselines
        And highlight persistent issues requiring attention
        And distribute reports to configured recipients
        And archive reports for compliance purposes
