Feature: System Performance Monitoring

    In order to ensure system reliability
    As a system administrator
    I want to monitor system performance metrics

    Scenario: Monitor system performance
        Given an operational data management system
        And defined performance thresholds
        When the monitoring process runs
        Then the system should collect performance metrics including:
          - Processing throughput rates
          - Storage utilization
          - Query response times
          - Background job completion rates
          - API availability and response times
        And generate alerts for metrics exceeding thresholds
        And provide historical trend analysis of performance
        And identify potential bottlenecks before they impact operations
